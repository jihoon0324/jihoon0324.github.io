# What is Amazon Web Services

The Aws system is the most widely adopted cloud platform as of 2021.  In addition, Aws offers far more services and in-service capabilities than other cloud providers, from infrastructure technologies such as computing, storage, and databases to new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lake and analysis, and the Internet of Things. This allows you to move existing applications to the cloud faster, easier, and more economically and build almost anything imaginable.



# What is clould

In short, cloud service is a service that stores all of the software on a super-large, high-performance computer connected to the Internet and can be used whenever necessary.  In general, in order to increase storage space, hard, which is storage space, is purchased on a local computer.  In addition, in order to use stored hardware, you must always have it physically.  However, with cloud services, you can conveniently use the information you have saved (documents, videos, etc.) as long as you connect to the Internet anywhere, regardless of location, even if you don't have physical hardware.

# Why we need for learn AWS.
